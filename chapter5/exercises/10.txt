// Exercise 10 from chapter 5

Considering the program prints the numbers as separate integers as it calculates each one(instead of calculating one single integer and displaying it after all the operations are complete), it's expected that each integer will be preceded by a minus(-) sign. For instance, the number -1256 will be inverted as -6-5-2-1 instead of -6521.
