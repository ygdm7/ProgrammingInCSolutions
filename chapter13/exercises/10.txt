// Exercise 10 from chapter 13

Assuming

#define printint(n) printf ("%i\n", x ## n)
#define printx(n) printint(x ## n)

it wouldn't be possible to display values x1 to x100 with the code

for (i = 1; i < 100; ++i)
    printx (i);

because printx would receive i as a number(1 for instance) and pass x1 to printint. printint would receive x1 and
add another x to the variable name, executing printf ("%i\n", xx1). Considering xx1 is not a variable name intended
to be used, the above code wouldn't produce the expected result.
